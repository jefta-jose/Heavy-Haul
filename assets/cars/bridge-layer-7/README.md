# Bridge Layer 7

Status: **planned** · class `heavy`, rank 7 of 20 · 10×10, 5 axles · 40 t empty · 600 kW · mud-terrain tires, 1.5 m
Load: **Bridge**, 15 t

Size: about 14 m long with its load. There is no length cap: draw it at its natural proportions (the game frames long vehicles with its zoom).

**Wheels (hard rule, see AGENTS.md):** 5 axles. Every tyre is a perfect circle (never oval or squashed), the same size, centred in its arch and filling it. Wheels under the weight: evenly spaced axles or a close rear tandem, as this kind of truck has them.

**Original design (hard rule, see AGENTS.md):** an original vehicle in the spirit of the kind described: no real make or model, no badges, logos, emblems, brand names or sponsor marks, and no copy of a real vehicle's exact shape, grille or lights.

## Art brief

- Vehicle: olive 10×10 military bridge-layer carrying a folded scissor bridge
- Load (drawn as part of the vehicle): the folded bridge sections
- Equipment: launch arm, spades
- Finish: mud
- Tires: 1.5 m mud-terrain tyres: deep chunky mud lugs with open voids; perfectly round, every tyre the same size

## Codex delivers (see AGENTS.md)

- [ ] `source/vehicle-master-v1.png`: the complete vehicle **with its load**, all wheels on, facing right, transparent, as a **strictly flat side profile** (the hard rule in AGENTS.md: no perspective, every tyre a perfect circle of the same size on one level line, no far-side tyres)
- [ ] `source/body-v1.png`: the same canvas with every road wheel removed (the load stays)
- [ ] `source/wheel-v1.png`: one matching tyre on a square transparent canvas, hub centred, a perfect circle
- [ ] `source/prompts.json`: the exact prompts and which image was an edit target
